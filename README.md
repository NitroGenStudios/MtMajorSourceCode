# Mt. Major Source Code
 
Here's probably all of the code used in the Game Off 2023 submission Mt. Major (https://nitro-gen-studios.itch.io/mt-major).

It's some truly terrible code, but my excuse is that I'm new to Godot. Don't destroy me over it please thanks.

Also just don't use my code in general, you can look at it and learn from it I guess?

I will post a youtube video about how the player movement works because it's really interesting and surprisingly smooth imo.
